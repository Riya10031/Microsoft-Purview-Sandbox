# Lab  07 - Implementing Microsoft Purview extension for Chrome

## Lab Overview

This implementation involves creating a Chrome extension that enhances the functionality of Microsoft Purview within the Chrome browser. DLP allows you to monitor onboarded Windows 10, and Windows 11 and onboarded macOS devices running any of the three latest released versions. Once a device is onboarded, DLP detects when sensitive items are used and shared. This gives you the visibility and control you need to ensure that they're used and protected properly, and to help prevent risky behaviour that might compromise them.

## Lab scenario

In this lab you'll be implementing the Microsoft Purview extension for Google Chrome in a controlled lab environment to secure the data. The primary objective is to fortify the data security measures, particularly by safeguarding against the uploading of data from unauthorized or unapproved browsers.

## Lab objectives

In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:
+ Task 1 : Prerequisites
+ Task 2 : Create a Data Loss Prevention policy
+ Task 3 : Updating Endpoint settings
+ Task 4 : Test the Extension

## Estimated timing: 120 minutes

### Task 1: Prerequisites

### Task 1.1: Configure the proxy server manually using "netsh" command

>**Note**: If you're onboarding Windows 10 or Windows 11 devices, we need to make sure that the device can communicate with the cloud DLP service.

1. From Start menu type cmd right-click **Command prompt** and select **Run as administrator**.

1. Enter the following command and press Enter:
    ```
    netsh winhttp set proxy 10.0.0.6:8080
    ```

   >**Note**: This will affect all applications including Windows services which use WinHTTP with default proxy.

### Task 1.2: Join device to Microsoft Entra

1. Select the Start menu and type, then choose **Settings** from the search results.
   
1. From the left menu select **Account** > **Access work or school** and click on **Connect** button.
   
1. On Sign in page select join to **Microsoft Entra ID** and sign in with following credential

   * Email/Username: <inject key="AzureAdUserEmail"></inject>
   
   * Password: <inject key="AzureAdUserPassword"></inject>
  
### Task 1.3: Onboard Windows 11 devices into Microsoft 365

1. Open Microsoft Edge and go to  **[compliance mirosoft com](https://compliance.microsoft.com/)** portal.

1. Choose Settings > Device onboarding.

1. Right-click on the extracted file **WindowsDefenderATPLocalOnboardingScript.cmd** again and choose **Run as Administrator**.

1. Enter **Y** to the question presented by the script and press **Enter**. When complete you should see a message in the command screen that says **Successfully onboarded machine to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint**.
   
1. Press any key to continue. This will close the Command Prompt window.

1. In Microsoft Defender portal in your browser.

1. Select **Settings** from the left menu bar, then from the Settings page select **Endpoints**.

1. On Onboarding page, under the section "2. Run a detection test", copy the detection test script by selecting the **Copy** button.

1. In the windows search bar of the virtual machine, type **CMD** and choose **Run as Administrator** on the right pane for the Command Prompt app. 

1. Paste the script by right-clicking in the **Administrator: Command Prompt** windows and press **Enter** to run it.

   **Note:** The window closes automatically after running the script.

   >**Note:** If you have completed the onboarding process and don't see devices in the Devices list after an hour, it might indicate an onboarding or connectivity problem.

1. In the purview portal, in the left-hand menu, select **Devices** and if the device isn't displayed, please wait for a while.

    >**Note:** If you have completed the onboarding process and don't see devices in the Devices list after an hour, it might indicate an onboarding or connectivity problem.
